# RecRoom-In-game-Discord-RPC
Update: You can keep 2fa on.
Made by: rockpikmin888#8888
This application gets your status of RecRoom and then applies it to your DiscordRPC.
This is an application that displays the the presence of your game to your Discord account RPC.
The only reason this program is obfuscated is to prevent skids from abusing apis to stalk other players.
Text from file !ReadMe.txt: 
Make sure you have 2FA off if you want this to work.
In order for this program to work correctly, you need to input your RecNet token into the txt file "AuthToken_Here.txt" (Nothing will be logged)
The only reason this program needs your bearer token is so it can make requests to get your: UserName, AccountId, and the room you're currently in. 
Enjoy!
